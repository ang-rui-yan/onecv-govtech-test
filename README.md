- The folder and file structure of this project was inspired by the organizational approach demonstrated in the `pgx-test-example` repository by [reshimahendra](https://github.com/reshimahendra/pgx-test-example/tree/master). I found the structuring and organization particularly effective for managing `pgx` connections and testing in Go applications.
